description: Explicitly route this project's Claude Code through the ZlauDeR masking proxy (writes .claude/settings.local.json, seeds practical zlauder.toml). Usually automatic; masking activates after a one-time restart of Claude Code (ZlauDeR blocks the first unrouted message until then, so nothing sends unmasked).

This is the per-project **routing** setup, and in most cases you don't need to run it:
the plugin AUTO-ENABLES routing the first time it sees a project (it writes the route on
the first session; masking activates after a one-time restart of Claude Code, which only
reliably picks up a freshly-written route at startup). Run `/zlauder:enable` to do
that explicitly — e.g. to turn routing back on after `/zlauder:disable`, or to refresh a
stale status-line path. It writes this project's **`.claude/settings.local.json`**
(which the plugin keeps out of git via a `.claude/.gitignore`, so the machine-specific
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>` is never committed) with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + `ZLAUDER_PORT`
and a `🛡` status line — wrapping any
line you already had as `🛡 … │ {your line}` (the original is saved and restored on
`/zlauder:disable`) — and seeds a practical starter `zlauder.toml` if absent. The
exhaustive reference is `zlauder.toml.example`. Hide the `🛡` segment with
`env.ZLAUDER_STATUSLINE=off`, or show it ONLY when masking is confirmed with
`env.ZLAUDER_STATUSLINE=shield`.

Report the result above, then make the activation model clear: a freshly-written route
takes effect reliably only after a **one-time restart** of Claude Code (it reads
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` from `settings.local.json` at startup; a mid-session pickup happens
only occasionally and can't be relied on). So tell the user to restart Claude Code once —
the statusline shows `⟳ ZlauDeR: restart to mask` until it's live, then `🛡`. Until this
session is routed, ZlauDeR **blocks** outbound messages so nothing reaches the API unmasked
(to send anyway without masking this session, set `ZLAUDER_NO_INTAKE_GATE=1`). Every session
after the first is masked automatically.

This command controls **routing** (whether traffic goes through the proxy at all, set once
and then effectively permanent). The everyday control is **masking** — on/off, profile,
categories — which is live and managed with `/zlauder:privacy`; flipping masking off leaves
routing in place (transparent pass-through) and can never strand the session. Confirm both
with `/zlauder:privacy` (or `/zlauder:privacy status`). Before UNINSTALLING the plugin, the
user should run `/zlauder:disable --all` so no project is left pointing at a proxy that's gone.
